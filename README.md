# PathFinding

This is my second personnal project : A simple pathfinding application on 2D board.
It took me a full month and a week of work and... procrastination to make it work as intended.
This was first done completely in visual studio 2017 before planing on pushing it on github (thus, no versioning.).

I'll try to add html page with either screenshots or video to showcase my app.

Thanks for dropping by !
