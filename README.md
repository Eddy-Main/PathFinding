# PathFinding

This is my second personnal project : A simple pathfinding application on 2D board using wxWidgets.
It took me around a full month and a week of work (with some break here and there) to make it work as intended.
This was first done completely in visual studio 2017 before planing on pushing it on github (thus, no versioning.).

You can check out the app by downloading the Pathfinding.exe file, checking the Presentation file
or by downloading the whole directory and setting up wxwidgets !

Thanks for dropping by !

(For my wxWidgets setup, I followed the tutorial from this youtube video :

starting from 10:20 to 21:00

and downloading wxwidgets from here : https://www.wxwidgets.org/ )
